# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Description

Heart Disease Prediction is a data science and machine learning project aimed at predicting the presence or absence of heart disease in individuals based on various medical and demographic features. The project utilizes historical medical data of patients to build predictive models that can accurately identify individuals at risk of heart disease.

Problem Statement

Heart disease is a significant health concern worldwide and a leading cause of mortality. Early detection of heart disease risk is crucial for timely intervention and prevention. Machine learning techniques can analyze patient data and identify patterns that indicate the presence of heart disease, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions and provide appropriate medical care.

Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing medical and demographic attributes of patients, such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant features. Each patient is labeled as having heart disease or being healthy based on diagnostic tests and medical history.

Methodology

The Heart Disease Prediction project follows a systematic approach:
Tasks to Be Performed:

Data Analysis:
a. Import the dataset: Load the heart disease dataset into the analysis environment.
b. Get information about the dataset: Compute statistics such as mean, max, min, quartiles, etc., for each field in the dataset.
c. Find the correlation between all fields: Analyze the correlation matrix to identify relationships between different features.

Data Visualization:
a. Visualize the number of patients with and without heart disease: Create a bar chart or pie chart to visualize the distribution of patients with heart disease and without heart disease.
b. Visualize age and heart disease: Plot age against heart disease status to understand the relationship between age and the occurrence of heart disease.
c. Visualize correlation between all features: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different features in the dataset.

Logistic Regression:
a. Build a simple logistic regression model:
i. Split the dataset into a 70:30 ratio for training and testing.
ii. Train the logistic regression model on the training set.
iii. Predict values on the test set using the trained model.
iv. Build the confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy score.

Decision Tree:
a. Build a decision tree model:
i. Split the dataset into a 70:30 ratio for training and testing.
ii. Train the decision tree model on the training set.
iii. Predict values on the test set using the trained model.
iv. Build the confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy.
v. Visualize the decision tree using the Graphviz package.

Random Forest:
a. Build a Random Forest model:
i. Split the dataset into a 70:30 ratio for training and testing.
ii. Train the Random Forest model on the training set.
iii. Predict values on the test set using the trained model.
iv. Build the confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy.
v. Visualize the Random Forest model using the Graphviz package.

Select the Best Model:
a. Print the confusion matrix of all classifiers: Display the confusion matrix for the logistic regression, decision tree, and Random Forest models.
b. Print the classification report of all classifiers: Generate a classification report including precision, recall, and F1 score for each model.
c. Calculate Recall, Precision, and F1 score of all the models: Evaluate the performance metrics for each classifier.
d. Visualize confusion matrix using heatmaps: Create heatmaps to visualize the confusion matrices for easy interpretation.
e. Select the best model based on the best accuracies: Compare the performance metrics and select the model with the highest accuracy.

By performing these tasks, the heart disease classification models will be evaluated, and the best model will be selected based on its performance metrics. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the data and help in building an accurate model for heart disease prediction.
